Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates an end-to-end analytical workflow, beginning with synthetic data generation and progressing through data cleaning, exploratory analysis, statistical evaluation, and visualization.

A dataset of 500 generated posts was constructed using randomized dates, categories, and engagement values. After loading the data into a Pandas DataFrame, the exploratory analysis confirmed structural consistency and allowed for a deeper understanding of its distribution and characteristics. Even in the absence of missing or inconsistent values, standard cleaning procedures—such as handling duplicates and enforcing proper data types—were applied to follow best practices.

The visual analysis provided meaningful insights into engagement behavior. The histogram revealed a wide distribution of likes with no dominant range, reflecting significant variability in post performance. The boxplot comparison across categories demonstrated similar engagement patterns among topics, with subtle distinctions in median and interquartile ranges.

Statistical evaluation supported these visual findings, offering a clearer understanding of overall engagement and category-level performance. These techniques mirror the type of evaluations companies perform when analyzing content strategies and optimizing digital campaigns.

Collectively, this project highlights strong analytical foundations, the ability to design and evaluate synthetic datasets, and the capacity to communicate insights through clear and purposeful visualizations.
